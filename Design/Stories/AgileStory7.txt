As a user I want to be able to click on a node on the main tree and have the tree fade away and 
new lines sprout from the node and lead to new smaller nodes that represent different theories within the field of science represented by the node I clicked on. 
And if I click on a theory the previous nodes will disappear and new nodes will sprout which represent different aspects or topics pertaining to a theory. 
For example if I click Biology an Evolution node should show up. 
And if I lick on Evolution then Natural Selection or the Hardy Weinberg Principle should show up. 
The size of the nodes should be determined by the number of citiations listed within the node.
